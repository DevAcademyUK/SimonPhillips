    <h1>About me<b id="orange">!</b></h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I am educated to GCSE level but have also completed a GNVQ in Business. I was'nt very sure what to as a degree as I have a multitude of interests. If I was to create a degree for myself it would be a mix mash of Political Science, Economics, Business and Technology.</p>

    <p>I have an overview and general understanding of full stack Javascript. I understand some of the computer science concepts and a little bit of advanced javascript.</p>

    <p>I am very interested in what economists are terming the fourth industrial revolution. Be the changing business models in response to the millennials generation preferences or the advent of technological development. An example would be a Just Energy who were featured on bloomberg last night.</p>

    <p>They are not only providing energy but providing customers with energy solutions. With a thermostat installed in the house they plan to integrate services be it choices between energy provider or the source of energy so customers can decide to have clean energy sources without taking from the grid. In the future they foresee a smart home that they can provide security, energy, water, groceries, lighting and sprinklers management all via their application.</p>

    <blockquote><pre>"Any skilled engineer can take control remotely of any connected 'thing'. Society has not yet realised the incredible scenerios this capability creates"</pre></blockquote>

    <p title="I like the idea of building full stack applications using all of the different tech stacks.">I am hoping to achieve experience and a job placement where I can build on that experience. I expect to have a full stack application at the end of the course that will showcase my skills in software engineering.</p>

    <p class="center"><i>I have a motorbike that I use to go to random places in the UK on the weekend. Other than that I enjoy reading.</i></p>

    <p class="center">I have also travelled...I have been across europe by train travelling to Paris, Antwerp, Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Hamburg, Copenhagen, Gothenburg, Stockholm, Helsinki, Tallinn, Riga, Vilnius, Warsaw, Krakov, Prague, Munich, Vienna, Budapest, Venice, Milan, Turin, Monaco, Marseille, Nice and Barcelona. All within 30 days.<br><strong>Iâ€™ve also been to Australia, China and India.</strong></p>
